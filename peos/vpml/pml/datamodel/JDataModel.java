/**
 * JDataModel is a generic modeling class that can be serialized
 * and issue events to registered listeners.  This class fires changed
 * events when the setIsDirty method is called to indicate that the data
 * in the class has been changed by a client.  In most cases JDataView classes
 * are the listeners used but you may derive your own from the DataListener
 * class and extend this interface to fit your application
 *
 * This class should be used to store ( or provide ) a centralized data location
 * for your application.  For example if you are writing a database application
 * you should create your database interface objects inside of a document and
 * then let view objects handle user interaction and then make calls to the
 * document class to actually perform changes to the data as requested by the
 * user.
 * By using this class you can have many views of one type of data.
 * Note that this class is much lighter in weight than the JComponent class 
 * which performs much similar tasks for graphical objects.  Using this class
 * you are not required to have a graphical aspect with your application at all.
