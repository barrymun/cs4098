Everything seems to be working, as far as it goes.  

The process layout is not very interesting; needs some color and
better placement of update buttons and checkboxes.  Probably, look at
moodle for ideas, and perhaps DU LIS web site for folding.

The test harness leaves a lot of crap around, and output isn't very
easy to understand. 

Need some documentation as to how the whole mess works.
