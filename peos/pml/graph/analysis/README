I.	Overview
	The PML Model Analysis tool can be used to view relationships between
	output files generated by the PML compiler.  Error analysis can be
	conducted through both a graphical and or text-driven approach.  The
	PML Model Analysis tool does not, however, make system calls to
	generate the required files for analysis.

II.	Requirements
	* Linux host
	* PEOS: pmlcheck, graphit
	* Tcl/tk
	* Tcldot version 1.10

III.	Progress
	VERSION 1.0
	* Interface infrastructure complete
		* Added option to select an error message
			* Higlight line from *.pml file
			* Highlight name from *.dot file (orange)
		* Known issues:
			* re-rendering a different graph causes	overlay 
				on the display
			* Solution: Create a method to delete all objects 
				on the canvas

IV.	Setup
	* Each file that will be analyzed must have three files in the
		directory.  These files must be in the following format:

			*.pml		(e.g. sample1.pml)
			*.analysis	(e.g. sample1.analysis)
			*.dot		(e.g. sample1.dot)
		
	* Use graphit (peos/src/pml/graph) to produce the required files.
		* pmlcheck (peos/src/pml/check) is called through graphit

V.	Running the GUI
	* Run the GUI by typing 'analyze.tk <filename.pml>'
		* If no name is entered, the program defaults to sample1.pml -
			located in the current directory.
	* A window with three frames will appear.
	* The left-most frame contains the original PML file
	* The upper right frame contains a graphical representation of the
		PML file.
	* The lower right frame contains the pmlcheck output file
	* Clicking on 'view' for any of the errors selects the appropriate 
		entities in the other two frames.
		* The PML file frame on the left will highlight the line
			indicated by the error.
		* The graph will highlight the node pertaining to the error 
			message clicked.
	* There is an option to reload the display located in the upper left
		corner of the GUI.
